jsPDF is a library to generate PDF files using Javascript. 
It can work both client side or server side. See the examples folder.

You must run the Downloadify example using a webserver due to 
Flash restrictions.


To build, install coffeescript for node.js and compile the jspdf.coffee with
	coffee -c jspdf.coffee
For development, will automatically recompile jspdf.coffee when it changes.
The -b tells coffeescript to use bare mode which prevents wrapping everything
in a closure, exposing a lot of internal functions (useful for debugging)
	coffee -bc --watch jspdf.coffee
